# CyberBook
 
This online book is a collection of my notes on all the subjects I came across on my pentest journey. Linux, Bash, Vim, C programming, Nmap etc etc. For a long time I've been searching for a handy system to store my notes but more important to quickly find something. While I do like Onenote the clear and simple way of a Gitbook really triggered me to get started. Another nice feature is the ability to export your book in pdf or ebook format. Nowadays an online book is also accessible on all online devices.

## Kudos to XAPAX
